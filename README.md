# 🎯 Smart Recommendation Engine

A **Recommendation System** built using Python and Machine Learning techniques to provide personalized item suggestions.  
This project demonstrates how platforms like **Netflix, Amazon, and Spotify** use recommendation algorithms to improve user experience.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build and compare different recommendation techniques:
- **Content-Based Filtering** – recommends items similar to those the user liked in the past.
- **Collaborative Filtering** – recommends items based on similar users' preferences.
- **Hybrid Approach (if implemented)** – combines the strengths of both methods.

## 📊 Key Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing** – handled missing values, removed duplicates, and prepared the dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – visualized patterns and user-item interactions.
3. **Model Building**  
   - Content-Based Filtering (using cosine similarity)  
   - Collaborative Filtering (user-user & item-item approaches)  
4. **Model Evaluation** – compared accuracy and quality of recommendations.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Jupyter Notebook** for implementation


## ⚡ Results
- Successfully implemented both **Content-Based** and **Collaborative Filtering**.
- Compared their performance and identified scenarios where each method works best.
- Gained insights into how real-world recommendation systems enhance personalization.
